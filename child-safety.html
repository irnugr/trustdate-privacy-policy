  <h1>Child Safety Standards – TrustDate</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 2025</p>

  <p>TrustDate ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to the safety of everyone who uses our app. This page sets out our standards and policies regarding <strong>Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE)</strong> and how we address child safety on our platform.</p>

  <h2 id="prohibition">1. Prohibition of Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation</h2>
  <p>TrustDate <strong>strictly prohibits</strong> all content and behavior that facilitates or constitutes Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE). This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM):</strong> Any visual depiction of a minor in sexually explicit conduct. We do not allow the creation, upload, storage, or distribution of CSAM on our platform.</li>
    <li><strong>Grooming:</strong> Befriending or building a relationship with a child online (or offline) for the purpose of sexual contact, sexual imagery, or exploitation.</li>
    <li><strong>Sextortion:</strong> Threatening or blackmailing a child using real or alleged access to the child’s intimate images.</li>
    <li><strong>Trafficking:</strong> Advertising, soliciting, or facilitating the commercial sexual exploitation of a child.</li>
    <li><strong>Sexualization of minors:</strong> Imagery or content that depicts, encourages, or promotes the sexual abuse of children or portrays children in a manner that could result in sexual exploitation.</li>
    <li><strong>Inappropriate interaction targeted at a child:</strong> Any conduct that endangers or harms a child.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not allow the use of TrustDate to promote predatory behavior toward children. Violations will result in removal of content, suspension or termination of accounts, and reporting to law enforcement and relevant authorities where required by law.</p>

  <h2 id="how-we-address-csam">2. How We Address CSAM and CSAE</h2>
  <p>When we obtain actual knowledge of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) or child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE) on our platform, we:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove the content without delay, in accordance with our standards and applicable law.</li>
    <li>Take action against the accounts and users involved, including permanent removal from the platform.</li>
    <li>Report to the <a href="https://report.cybertip.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC)</a> or the <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/148666" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relevant regional authority</a> as required by law.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We comply with applicable child safety laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate.</p>
